## Setup

1. Create a Discord bot and invite it to your server.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project or set up the proper environment variables on your
   deployment environment. Use the `.env.example` file as a template.
3. Run `pnpm run register` to register your bot commands.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the bot.

## Custom LLMs

Any OpenAI compatible API can be used as well. See `.env.example` for example.
